# OpenAI_Lunar_Lander
This repository contains information relating to experiments on Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm performance in the OpenAI gym LunarLander-v2 environment. The experiments test and record the performance of various differentiations of OpenAI's open source code for deep reinforcement learning algorithms.


The Lunar Experiment Notes Log is my personal log of the experiments with notes regarding algorithmic structure and performance variations. The Figure section contains graphs of performance metrics for tested algorithms.
