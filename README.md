# OpenAI_Lunar_Lander
This repository contains information relating to experiments on algorithm performance in the OpenAI gym LunarLander-v2 environment. The experiments test and record the performance of various differentiations of OpenAI's open source code for deep reinforcement learning algorithms.

The Solved folder includes my writeup and information regarding an algorithm solving OpenAI's LunarLander-v2 enviornment. The Figure section contains graphs of performance metrics for algorithms with variations in performance and structure. A complete guide for how to install the LunarLander and LunarLanderContinuous enviornments can be found at the following link, https://medium.com/@brian.s.haney44/installing-spinningup-for-mac-os-x-9d5e24dc565a. A video of the optimized algorithm can be found at the following link, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_f66jrAWiM.
